h3(#installation-and-usage). Installation and usage

p. The general behavior stands:

# Go to your Textpattern installation's admin panel.
# Navigate to Admin / Plugins.
# Download and open the plugin code.
# Copy the plugin code to the install plugin box.
# Click install and go thru the automated installation process.
# After installation find the plugin from the plugin list and click Activate.
# Now the plugin is installed and ready to be used.

h3(#attributes). Attributes

p. The tag is @<txp:rah_runtime />@ and attributes for it follow.

p. *index*
With this attribute you can nest several tag pairs and count several independent runtimes.
Example: @index="1"@ Default: @"0"@

p. *format*
Return formated version of the time. Will make the time respect power of ten, and SI units smaller than microsends won't be returned, just microsends with decimals. By default, used (@1@).
Example: @format="0"@ Default: @"1"@

p. *persistent*
If set to @1@, the runtime is kept alive after outputting the time. Normally the runtime pair is destroyed after using it, but with @persistent@ the initial runtime is still usable. The attribute is useful, if you want to calculate multiple runtimes from same single starting point.
Example: @persistent="1"@ Default: @"0"@

h3(#example). Examples

p. *Simple usage:*

bc. <txp:rah_runtime />
	<!--
		Some code here, for example:
		<txp:article />
	-->
Runtime: <txp:rah_runtime />

p. Returns: @[...] Runtime: 0.000011@

p. *Using multiple nested tag pairs:*

bc. <txp:rah_runtime index="2" />
<txp:rah_runtime index="1" />
Time1: <txp:rah_runtime index="1" />
Time2: <txp:rah_runtime index="2" />

p. Returns: @Time1: 0.000081 Time2: 0.000184@

p. *Using persistent runtimes:*

bc. <!--
	Start the runtime timer
-->
<txp:rah_runtime persistent="1" />
	<!--
		Some code here, for example:
		<txp:article />
	-->
<!--
	Output runtime
-->
<txp:rah_runtime persistent="1" />
	<!--
		Some more code here, for example:
		<txp:article />
	-->
<!--
	Output runtime, calculated
	from the same original starting point
-->
<txp:rah_runtime persistent="1" />
	<!--
		Even some more code.
	-->
<!--
	Destroy and output the final runtime,
	calculated from the same original starting point
-->
<txp:rah_runtime />

p. Note that every one of the tags has @persistent@ attribute. If the tag doesn't have it, then the runtime pair is destroyed after outputting it. To finally destroy the runtime, set persistent to @"0"@ (zero) or remove the attribute.
